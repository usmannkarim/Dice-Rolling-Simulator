Here's a breif introduction to my this project on python.

"Dice Rolling Simulator - A Python Project

This project was assigned to me as a task during my initial semesters at university. The goal of the project was to create a dice rolling simulator using Python. The project consists of a single Python file that simulates the rolling of a die and outputs the result.

The dice rolling simulator uses the random module in Python to generate random numbers, simulating the roll of a die. The user is able to specify the number of sides on the die, and the program will generate a random number within the specified range.

This project is a great introduction to the basics of programming in Python and provides a simple example of how to use the random module.
